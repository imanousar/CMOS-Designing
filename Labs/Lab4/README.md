# Perform TRAN simulation


### Description of exercise

1.Determine the response of a simple RC filter to input square wave signal.
Notes: parameters of the square wave - duration of the high state TH = 5 ms, rise and fall times 1 ns, period 10 ms. The simulation should last two periods of the square wave. Set the filter time constant to TH/5.

Attach plot with input and output signals. 

2.Calculate the response of a simple RC filter to input sine wave.
Notes: filter time constant Ï„ = 1 ms, sine wave frequency set equal to the filter cutoff frequency. The simulation should last two periods of the sine wave. 

Attach plot with input and output signals.
