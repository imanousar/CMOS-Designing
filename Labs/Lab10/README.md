# Determine Id vs. Vds characteristics

### Description of exercise
Determine Id (drain current) vs. Vds (drain-source voltage) characteristics for n-MOS transistor.

Take the  n-MOSFET  transistor from the  Components  Library and set its parameters:  Vt0  to 0.4,  Lambda  to 0.01. Perform the simulation for different Vgs (from 0.5 to 1.5V). Sweep Vds from 0 to 3V.
<br>

Check the characteristics for different W (eg 1um, 15um, 45um).
<br>

Attach only one plot. Label x-axis as Vds [V] and left axis as Id [A].
